                    <p id="one">The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the biggest, heaviest and most expensive version of 
                        Apple’s smartphone for 2020, a beast in every dimension.
                    </p>
                    <p id="two">
                        The top-of-the-range iPhone costs from £1,099 and sits above the 12 Pro (£999),
                        the 12 (£799) and 12 mini (£699).
                    </p>
                    <p id="three">
                        The 12 Pro Max has the same fresh design as the rest of the iPhone 12 range:
                        squared-off sides, all-screen front with slimmer bezels and a frosted glass back.
                        It has the same drop-resistant “Ceramic Shield” technology covering the screen and
                        the new MagSafe magnetic attachment system on the back for wireless chargers 
                        and accessories, but that’s where the physical similarities end.

                        The huge OLED display measures 6.7in on the diagonal, which dwarfs all other iPhones
                        and rivals the Android superphones, such as the 6.78in OnePlus 8 or the 6.9in 
                        Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
                    </p>
                    <p id="five">
                        The screen is stunning. Bright, crisp and almost tablet-like at that giant size.
                        Watching HDR video is fantastic, and there is a good set of stereo speakers too.
                    </p>
                    <p id="six">
                        Holding it usually requires two hands, much like its superphone competition.
                        It is very wide and weighs 226g – 18g heavier than the Note 20 Ultra, 39g heavier than the smaller 12 Pro or a full 64g heavier than the regular iPhone 12.
                    </p>
                    <p id="seven">
                        Thanks to the hard edges I found gripping the 12 Pro Max significantly easier than its rounded and equally heavy predecessor the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
                        I could use it one handed with a bit of finger gymnastics and suffered none of the hand pain I got from trying to grip the bar-of-soap-like 11 Pro Max.

                            Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s battery – 
                            typically smartphone batteries last at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity –
                            but it can be replaced for £69. An out-of-warranty service costs £566.44, which includes the screen.
                            The iPhone 12 Pro Max was awarded six out of 10 for repairability by the specialist iFixit.

                            The 12 Pro Max uses 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board,
                            99% recycled tungsten, 98% recycled rare earth elements and at least 35% recycled plastic in multiple other components.
                            Apple is also using renewable energy for final assembly of the machine, and breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report.

                            This includes the home screen visual overhaul with widgets and the App Library folders,
                             enhanced privacy tools and the new Translate app. For more see the iOS 14 overview and iPhone 12 review.

                            The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the same selfie camera and ultrawide camera as the 12 and 12 Pro, which perform just as well, but different main and telephoto cameras on the back.
                        </p>
                        <p id="thirteen">
                            The telephoto camera has a longer 2.5x optical zoom, up from 2x. Any increase in reach is welcome, but it pales in comparison to the 4x/5x optical zooms of competitors. The lens is slightly slower than that on the 12 Pro, making it worse in poor light. But both smartphones switch to the more light-sensitive main camera in low-light anyway.
                        </p>
                        <p id="fourteen">
                            The main camera has the same 12-megapixel resolution but a 47% physically larger sensor, which collects up to 87% more light than its predecessor.
                        </p>
                        <p id="fiveteen">
                            In good light it shoots photos that are indistinguishable from the 12 Pro: highly detailed with good colour accuracy and control of high-contrast scenes.
                        </p>
                        <p id="sixteen">
                            In good light it shoots photos that are indistinguishable from the 12 Pro: highly detailed with good colour accuracy and control of high-contrast scenes.
                        </p>
                        <p id="seventeen">
                            When the light level starts to drop around dusk the larger sensor captures far brighter, more detailed and less noisy images that are a marked improvement over other iPhones. The same holds true for indoor shots on dull winter days. The dedicated Night Mode is needed less frequently, too, and when it does engage it captures photos quicker than the regular 12 Pro.
                        </p>
                        <p id="eighteen">
                            Overall, the 12 Pro Max has the best camera on any iPhone and has improved low-light performance over other iPhone 12 models. It also brings Apple up to par with top competitors, although the 2.5x optical zoom is still some way behind the best in the business.
